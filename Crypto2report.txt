Crypto 2

I opened the cipher algorithem and quickly found that it was doing xor.
From previous research I found that you could likely bruteforce the key.
I used an online cracker https://wiremask.eu/tools/xor-cracker/ to get the message.

Now, this is a story all about how my bits got flipped-xor'd upside down. So I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, and I'll tell you how I became the flag to a CCT quals chal.
