Crypto 3 

Based off of the format of the crypto3.pub I beleived this to be an RSA key and cipher3 to be the cryptotext.

I researched RSA attacks online and found a tool that could do a variety of attacks (hastads attack ,factordb ,mersenne_primes,noveltyprimes,smallq,wiener,primefactorization ,fermat factorization, Pollard_p_1, londahl).
Was not able to solve the challenge.
